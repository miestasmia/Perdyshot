# These settings were carefully crafted for #
# Elementary OS 0.3 Freya.    If  something #
# doesn't  work on your distro,  try modify #
# this file.   Chances are with a few modi- #
# fications, you can get it to work on your #
# distro, too.                              #

    # The paths to the images used for border perfection

    # is probably the reason.   Either supply your own images, or just set these to an empty string, if
    # you wish to disable it.
    #
    # The settings with names ending in "DM" are deletion maps.  A transparent pixel represents a pixel
    # to be left untouched,  and any other colour will  result in the pixel  being deleted,  before the
    # corresponding overlay image is applied.
